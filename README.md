# About W3bstream

## Overview

[**W3bstream**](https://w3bstream.com/) is a decentralized protocol that connects data generated in the physical world to the blockchain world. To learn more about the vision behind W3bstream through the words of the IoTeX co-founder and CEO, Raullen Chai, have a look at the video linked below: ðŸ‘‡

{% endhint %}

In essence, W3bstream uses a decentralized network of nodes, which stream data from real word devices and machines. Proofs of real-world facts are generated on top of the data for utilization by dApps on various L1 and L2 blockchains.

Blockchain developers can leverage the W3bstream framework to access trusted real-world data for their dApps.

## W3bstream Node architecture

To cater to a wide range of applications and business requirements, a W3bstream node encompasses the following connectivity, computing, storage, and consensus components. These interact with IoT devices, the blockchain, and node operators:

<details>

<summary>Service Endpoint</summary>

The service endpoint implements a number of communication protocols (e.g., MQTT, HTTP, RPC, etc.) to communicate with smart devices, blockchain, and node operators.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Virtual File System</summary>

The virtual file system is used to store a business program (i.e., WebAssembly modules that implement the business logic of a specific MachineFi application) as well as intermediate computation results**.**

</details>

<details>

<summary>Execution Engine</summary>

The W3bstream execution engine runs the pre-defined business logic that process incoming data from smart devices, blockchain events, and more. The execution engine is based on a WebAssembly VM and the WASI interface, and it can run multiple WASM modules in parallel.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Consensus</summary>

The consensus module implements a number of consensus algorithms (e.g., Proof of Authority -PoA, Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance â€“ PBFT, etcâ€¦) for realizing a decentralized W3bStream network.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Database</summary>

The database component represents an abstract storage interface and its goal is to serve as the long term storage of the raw/encrypted data received from smart devices. Different storage implementations can be plugged in: from a simple local relational database, to a decentralized storage solution like IPFS. Data retention policies can also be configured for this module, depending on the application needs.

<details>

<summary>SSI Wallet</summary>

The SSI wallet implements decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials-related functionalities for managing identities in a W3bstream node.

## Lifecycle

The W3bstream Network encourages communities to run nodes to support the burgeoning ecosystem of MachineFi dApps. Depending on a specific dApp's requirements, a certain number of W3bstream nodes might be employed to serve it. Such a subnet of W3bstream nodes will commence operation when a sufficient number of community nodes have joined.

Any community member interested in operating a W3bstream node could provision a virtual machine on the cloud or set up a local server.
